# Flutter Flavors Demo

## What are Flutter Flavors?

In the context of a Flutter project, "Flavors" refer to the ability to create multiple variants of your app, each tailored for a specific environment or purpose. Think of them as configurations for different target audiences, such as development, testing, staging, and production. Flutter Flavors allow you to have different app behaviors, features, and branding without duplicating your codebase.

## Why do we need Flutter Flavors?

Flutter Flavors are essential for several reasons:

- **Environment Isolation:** They help you isolate the code and configuration for different environments, reducing the risk of accidentally deploying development code in production.

- **Branding and Theming:** You can customize your app's branding, theme, and assets for each flavor. For example, you might want different logos or color schemes for different environments.

- **API Endpoints:** You can configure different API endpoints for development, staging, and production environments, making it easy to switch between them.

- **Feature Flags:** You can enable or disable features specific to a particular flavor. This is useful for testing features that are still in development or for providing different feature sets for different audiences.

- **Package Management:** You can manage different sets of packages or dependencies for each flavor, optimizing the app's size and performance.

## 3. How to Use Flutter Flavors

This project demonstrates how to use Flutter Flavors effectively. Follow these steps to set up and run different flavors of the app:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flutter-flavors-demo.git
   
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```shell
   cd flutter-flavors-demo
3. Install Dependencies:
   ```shell
   flutter pub get
4. Run the App with a Flavor:
   To run a specific flavor, use the following command:
   ```shell
   flutter run --flavor <flavor_name> -t lib/main_<flavor_name>.dart
   ```
   Replace <flavor_name> with the name of the flavor you want to run (e.g., development, staging, production).
5. Enjoy the Different Flavors:
   Explore how each flavor of the app behaves differently, such as using different API endpoints, themes, and       features.
